<img class="photoRight" src="files/tutorials/miller.jpg" alt="Julian Miller"/>

<p>Cartesian Genetic Programming is a form of genetic programming. It was
developed by Julian Miller with Peter Thomson in 1997. In its classic form it
uses a very simple integer based genetic representation of a program in the
form of a directed graph. It employs a representation in which some genes are
non-coding (i.e. are 'junk'). Simple evolutionary algorithms can be used to
exploit this redundancy through genetic drift. In a number of studies, CGP has
been shown to be highly efficient compared to other GP techniques on a range of
benchmark problems.</p>

<p>Since its original inception CGP has been enhanced in various ways by Julian
Miller and James Walker to include automatically defined functions.  The
tutorial will cover the classic technique, advanced developments and
applications to a variety of problem domains.</p>

<p>Julian. F. Miller, BSc (Lond), PhD (City), PGCLTHE (Bham). Dr. Miller's
obtained his first degree in Physics from the University of London in 1980 and
obtained his doctorate in Nonlinear Mathematics from the City University in
1988. He worked at Napier University from 1989-1999 and the Natural Computation
research group in the School of Computer Science at the University of
Birmingham from 1999-2003. He joined the Department of Electronics at the
University of York in Oct 2003. He has chaired twelve international workshops

<p>Co-evolutionary learning has been used to learn strategies for playing various
games, from iterated prisoner's dilemma to chess and from trading games to
checkers. This tutorial uses iterated prisoner's dilemma games as an example to
illustrate how co-evolution can be used to learn game-playing strategies
without any teacher information. A number of important research issues, which
are not specific to any particular games, will be discussed, including:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Representation of strategies and the genotype-phenotype mapping</li>
	<li>The role of diversity (including genetic diversity and behavioural diversity) in co-evolutionary learning</li>
	<li>Generalisation ability of evolved strategies and an ensemble approach to improve generalisation ability</li>
	<li>A vigorous quantitative framework for measuring generalisation of co-evolutionary learning</li>

<p>The field of Evolutionary Computation has experienced tremendous growth over
the past 20 years, resulting in a wide variety of evolutionary algorithms and
applications. The result poses an interesting dilemma for many practitioners
in the sense that, with such a wide variety of algorithms and approaches, it is
often hard to  se the relationships between them, assess strengths and
weaknesses, and make good choices for new application areas.</p>

<p>This tutorial is intended to give an overview of a general EC framework that
can help compare and contrast approaches, encourages crossbreeding, and
facilitates intelligent design choices. The use of this framework is then
illustrated by showing how traditional EAs can be compared and contrasted with
it, and how new EAs can be effectively designed using it.</p>

<p>Finally, the framework is used to identify some important open issues that need
further research.</p>

<p>Computing has changed many aspects of our daily life. It certainly has shaken
the foundation of finance and economics research and changed the research
frontier. Advances in both hardware and software allow us to study finance and
economic in ways that were previously impossible. Expertise in both computing
and finance and economics allow us to make impacts that neither computer
scientists nor financial experts or economists can make on their own. For
example, evolutionary computation has helped us to discover forecasting rules,
bargaining strategies and economic models. The use of artificial markets
enables us to understand better some of the fundamental concepts in economics,
such as rationality and the efficient market hypothesis. Finance and economics
are not the only disciplines that benefit from this interdisciplinary research.
Computer science benefit too, as applications drive research. Search techniques
were developed to focus an evolutionary in solutions that are important to
users. The need for finding scarce opportunities motivated new computational
methods in genetic programming. In this tutorial, I shall give an overview of
research in these techniques as well as their applications.</p>

<p>Edward Tsang is professor of Computer Science at the University of Essex. He
specializes in business application of artificial intelligence and his research
interests include artificial intelligence applications, computational finance,
constraint satisfaction, evolutionary computation, and heuristic search. He was
co-founder and Deputy Director (2003-2008) of Centre for Computational Finance
and Economic Agents (CCFEA) at University of Essex and is also a founding
member and Deputy Director (2008-) of the Centre for Computational Intelligence
at University of Essex, which specializes in applications of computational
intelligence techniques. Edward is the author of Foundations of Constraint
Satisfaction, the first book to define the scope of the field and founded the
Computation Finance and Economics Technical Committee in IEEE's Computational
Intelligence Society in 2004. He has been consultant to GEC Marconi, British
Telecom, the Commonwealth Secretariat and other organizations.</p>

<p>Traditionally, hardware has been static at run-time. However, with the
introduction of reconfigurable technology and devices, dynamic hardware is now
possible to realize by using automatic design schemes. One method for automatic
design is evolvable hardware. The recent years of development of this field can
be characterized as a continuous search for promising problems from the point
of view of evolutionary design.</p>

<p>In the first part of the tutorial, fundamental concepts of evolutionary circuit
design and evolvable hardware will be introduced. Examples of evolved
innovative designs will be presented in domains of small combinational
circuits, middle-size circuits (such as image filters or arithmetic circuits)
and large circuits (benchmarks for testability analysis methods), covering thus
circuit complexity from a few gates to millions of gates. The second part will
give an overview of the field targeting run-time evolvable systems. This
includes an introduction of reconfigurable technology followed by a description
of a number of the adaptable architectures that have been proposed. Challenges
related to evolving systems in operation will also be addressed. A special
focus will be given to the architectures designed for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Jim Torresen received his M.Sc. and Dr.ing. (Ph.D) degrees in computer
architecture and design from the Norwegian University of Science and
Technology, University of Trondheim in 1991 and 1996, respectively. He has been
employed as a senior hardware designer at NERA Telecommunications (1996-1998)
and at Navia Aviation (1998-1999). Since 1999, he has been a professor at the
Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo (associate professor
1999-2005). Jim Torresen has been a visiting researcher at Kyoto University,
Japan for one year (1993-1994) and four months at Electrotechnical laboratory,
Tsukuba, Japan (1997 and 2000).</p>

<p>His research interests at the moment include reconfigurable hardware,
evolvable hardware, system-on-chip design and applying this to complex
real-world applications. Several novel methods have been proposed. He has
published a number of scientific papers in international journals, books and
conference proceedings. He is in the program committee of more than ten
different international conferences as well as a regular reviewer of a number
of international journals (mainly published by IEEE and IET). He also acts as
an evaluator for proposals in EU FP7.</p>

<p>Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary technique for getting
computers to automatically solve problems without having to tell them
explicitly how to do it (Koza, 1992).  Since its inception genetic
programming has been used to solve many practical problems including
producing a number of human competitive results and even patentable
new inventions (Poli et al, 2008).</p>

<p>This tutorial includes two parts. In the first part I will introduce
the basics of GP practice, briefly explaining GP representations,
operators and search algorithm, and showing examples of real
runs. This will mainly be based on (Koza, 1992) and (Poli et al,
2008). In the second part of the tutorial, I will then concentrate on
explaining how and why GP works. This will done by first
characterising GP's search space (the space of all possible programs)
and then by explaining the way in which GP explores such a space. This
will be based mainly on (Langdon and Poli, 2002) and (Poli et al,
2008).</p>

<p>Despite its technical contents, the tutorial will require limited
mathematical background.</p>

<h3 id="hyper">Hyper-heuristics: An Emerging Paradigm in Evolutionary Computation</h3>

<ul class="details">

</ul>

<img class="photoRight" src="files/tutorials/edmundBurke.jpg" alt="Riccardo Poli Photo"/>

<p>This tutorial will introduce and discuss an emerging methodology in
search/optimisation and decision support systems: Hyper-heuristics. The term
can be thought of as describing "heuristics to choose heuristics". It is
concerned with search methods which explore a search space of heuristics
(rather than a search space of potential solutions to a problem). The approach
is (partially) motivated by the aim of investigating the automation of the
heuristic design process. The hope is that hyper-heuristics will lead to more
general systems that are able to automatically operate over a wider range of
problem domains than is possible today. The goal is to develop methodlogies
which can adapt to different environments without manually having to customise
the search, or its parameters, for each particular problem domain. This can be
seen as one of the drawbacks of many current metaheuristic and evolutionary
implementations, which tend to have to be customised for a particular class of
problems or even specific problem instances. Of course, evolutionary methods
and other metaheuristics can be developed and employed as hyper-heuristics.
Indeed, recently published work has explored a range of metaheuristic and
evolutionary algorithms within the context of hyper-heuristics and this
tutorial will present and discuss these (and other) approaches.</p>

<p>Although the term hyper-heuristic is relatively new, the basic idea has
actually been around for over 40 years and this tutorial will give a
brief history of the area, before discussing work carried out to date
and then focussing on some observations and promising research directions.</p>

approaches to learning in games: evolution (including co-evolution), and
temporal difference learning (TDL).</p>

<p>It will be shown that the choice of function approximation architecture has
a critical impact on what is learned. In addition to standard MLPs, attention
is also given to N-Tuple systems and interpolated table-based approximators, as
these have recently shown great potential to learn quickly and effectively.
Examples will be used to illustrate how the function approximator must be
appropriately matched with the learning algorithm in order to get best
results.</p>

<p>Each method will be demonstrated with reference to some simple fragments of
software, illustrating how the learning algorithm is connected with the game
and with the function approximation architecture. Example games will include
GridWorld, Othello, and Simulated Car Racing.</p>

<p>Recent results on the information rate limits attainable for these learning
algorithms (in terms of bits of information gained per game played) will also
be discussed.</p>

<h3 id="pso">Particle Swarm Optimization: A Universal Optimizer?</h3>

<p>The main objective of this tutorial will be to answer the question if
particle swarm optimization (PSO) can be considered as a universal optimizer.
In the context of this tutorial, this means that the PSO can be applied to a
wide range of optimization problem types as well as search domain types. The
tutorial will start with an overview of the original, basic PSO, its origins,
and some of the first adaptations of the basic PSO to improve its performance.
This will be followed by a short discussion on heuristics to select proper
values for control parameters. The remainder and bulk of the tutorial will
cover a classification of different problem types, and will show how PSO can be
applied to solve problems of these types. This part of the tutorial will be
organized in the following sections, one for each problem type:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Continuous-valued versus discrete-valued domains</li>
	<li>Unimodal versus multi-modal landscapes</li>
	<li>Multi-solution problems requiring niching capabilities</li>
	<li>Constrained versus unconstrained problems, also covering boundary constraints</li>
	<li>Multi-objective optimization</li>
	<li>Dynamic environments</li>
</ul>

<p>It will be shown that PSO can solve these problems with minor adaptation of the
basic PSO without violating the foundational principles of PSO. For each of these
problem types a small subset of the most successful algorithms will be discussed.</p>

<h3 id="tuning">Principled Approaches to tuning EA parameters</h3>

<p>Finding appropriate parameter values for evolutionary algorithms (EA) is one
of the persisting grand challenges of the evolutionary computing (EC) field.
On the one hand, all EC researchers and practicioners acknowledge that good
parameter values are essential for good EA performance.  On the other hand,
even after 30 years of EC research there is very little known about the effect
of EA parameters on EA performance. Users mostly rely on conventions (mutation
rate should be low), ad hoc choices (why not use uniform crossover), and
experimental comparisons on a limited scale (testing combinations of three
different crossover rates and three different mutation rates).  Hence, there is
a striking gap between the widely acknowledged importance of good parameter
values and the widely exhibited ignorance concerning principled approaches to
tune EA parameters.</p>

<p>The aims of this tutorial are threefold: creating awareness, providing
guidelines, and presenting a vision for future development. As for the
awareness, we will discuss the matter of EA parameters, catagorize different
ways of setting them, and discuss the most important related issues, inlcuding
performance measures and test functions.  In the guidelines section we review
existing algorithmic approaches to parameter tuning.  We will discuss sweep
methods, search methods, and combined methods, positioning them on a feature
map and present (comparative) results on their usefulness.  In the last part,
we take a future-oriented attitude and identify research areas with high
relevance and potential impact.</p>

<h3 id="multiCrit">Recent Challenges to Evolutionary Multi-Criterion Optimization (EMO)</h3>

<p>Many real-world search and optimization problems involve multiple objectives
which are conflicting to each other. These problems give rise to a set of
Pareto-optimal solutions which must be found and a decision-making task must be
used to choose a particular preferred solution. Since 1993, Evolutionary
algorithms (EAs) have been amply demonstrated to find a well-distributed set of
near Pareto-optimal solutions in many problems. In this tutorial, we shall
discuss a number of such evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO)
techniques, assess the current state-of-the-art techniques, and highlight a
number of recent challenges which must be paid more attention. Some of these
challenges include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Inclusion of multi-criterion decision-making aides within EMO framework so as to achieve both optimization and decision-making tasks to find a single preferred solution.</li>
	<li>Handling a large number of objectives (such as 10 or more) which often arise in real-world scenarios.</li>
	<li>Handling practical complexities using EMO, such as uncertainties in decision variables and parameters, reliability issues, computationally demanding solution evaluation, non-linear constraints etc.</li>
	<li>Handling dynamic multi-objective optimization problems in which objectives and constraints change with the progress of an EMO simulation</li>
	<li>Use of EMO principles to other problem solving tasks</li>
	<li>Use of EMO methodology for knowledge extraction in real-world problems</li>
</ol>

<p>This tutorial is aimed for both novices and users of EMO. Those without any
knowledge in EMO will have adequate ideas of the procedures and their
importance in computing and problem-solving tasks. Those who have been
practicing EMO will also have enough ideas and materials for future research,
know state-of-the-art results and techniques, and make a comparative evaluation
of their research.</p>
