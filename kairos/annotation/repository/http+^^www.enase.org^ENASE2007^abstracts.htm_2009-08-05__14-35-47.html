		Abstract:</DIV></TD><TD class="textoNormal" vAlign="center"><DIV align=justify>
			Although agent technology is gaining world wide popularity, a 
			hindrance to its uptake is the lack of proper testing mechanisms for 
			agent based systems. While many traditional software testing methods 
			can be generalized to agent systems, there are many aspects that are 
			different and which require an understanding of the underlying agent 
			paradigm. In this paper we present certain aspects of a testing 
			framework that we have developed for agent based systems. The 
			testing framework is a model based approach using the design models 
			of the Prometheus agent development methodology. In this paper we 
			focus on unit testing and identify the appropriate units, present 
			mechanisms for generating suitable test cases and for determining 
			the order in which the units are to be tested, present a brief 
			overview of the unit testing process and an example. Although we use 
			the design artefacts from Prometheus the approach is suitable for 
			any plan and event based agent system.</DIV></TD></TR>  <TR><TD height=23 colSpan=2 vAlign=top class="Textojustificadoazulescuro"><HR></TD></TR>

		Abstract:</DIV></TD><TD class="textoNormal" vAlign="center"><DIV align=justify>
			The concept of software product is often associated to software 
			code; process documents are, therefore, considered as by-products. 
			Also very frequently, customers primarily demand &#8221;results&#8221; and, in a 
			second place, documentation. Development efforts are then focused on 
			code production at the expense of documents quality and 
			corresponding verification activities. As discussed within this 
			paper, one of the root problems for this is that documentation in 
			the context of methodologies is often described with not enough 
			level of detail. This paper presents a metamodel that faces this 
			problem. It is an extension of ISO/IEC 24744, the metamodel for 
			methodologies development. Under this extension, documents can 
			become the drivers of the methodology activities. Documents will be 
			the artifact in which method engineers should focus for methodology 
			development, by defining its structure and constraints. Developers 
			will put their effort in filling sections of the documents as the 
			way to progress in the process execution. This process execution 
			will be guided by those documents defined by the method engineers. 
			This approach can be, as well, the basis for a new approach to a 
			Document-Centric Software Engineering Environment.</DIV></TD></TR>  <TR><TD height=23 colSpan=2 vAlign=top class="Textojustificadoazulescuro"><HR></TD></TR>

		Abstract:</DIV></TD><TD class="textoNormal" vAlign="center"><DIV align=justify>
			Rule-based programming paradigm is omnipresent in number of 
			engineering domains. However, there are some fundamental semantical 
			differences between it, and classic procedural, or object-oriented 
			approaches. Even though, there has been a lot of effort to use rules 
			to model business logic in classic software no generic solution has 
			been provided so far. In this paper a new approach for generalized 
			rule-based programming is given. It is based on a use of advanced 
			rule representation, which includes an extended attribute-based 
			language, a non-monotonic inference strategy, with explicit 
			inference control on the rule level. The paper shows how some 
			typical programming constructions, as well as classic programs can 
			be modelled in this approach. The approach can largely improve both 
			the design and the implementation of complex software.</DIV></TD></TR>  <TR><TD height=23 colSpan=2 vAlign=top class="Textojustificadoazulescuro"><HR></TD></TR>

			Not every software engineering task will qualify as scientific 
			research, because the solution of the problem should contribute to 
			the body of scientific knowledge. This means that, on one hand, the 
			research work should correspond to the state of the art of 
			scientific body of knowledge and give a particular, small, 
			contribution to it, and, on the other hand, the work of the student 
			shall clearly contribute to at least one general phase of software 
			development. Taking into consideration that bachelor thesis are an 
			initial research and the simplest scientific research at the 
			university, the minimum requirements for the scope of bachelor 
			thesis, thus, should not exceed one software development phase and 
			one research phase, still keeping the requirement that the bachelor 
			student must be able to position clearly his work in both, namely, 
			scientific and software development life cycles. Therefore the life 
			cycle of scientific research is analyzed from the perspective of 
			software engineering life cycle and the main activities of both are 
			mapped into single schema. 16 types of bachelor thesis in software 
			engineering proposed in the paper are a helpful tool for bachelor

			Agile methods have been proposed to increase customer satisfaction 
			and deliver business value early, yet usually don&#8217;t focus on 
			progress visibility other than software deliverables. However, many 
			customers demand risk visibility over the main aspects that define 
			their expectations: functionality (scope), budget, time-to-market, 
			and product quality. This article proposes an agile commitment 
			framework based on structured definition and follow-up of 
			commitments among customers and developers. The framework uses 
			commitment management to improving risk management by enhancing 
			visibility of business expectation risks, by providing a negotiation 
			baseline among customers and developers, and by allowing mitigating 
			action when appropriate. Finally, we summarize several case studies 
			run to evaluate the proposed framework in academic and industrial

			Many development tools of modern Integrated Development Environments

			for model implementation. As well as an abstract syntax, a concrete 
			syntax of the language it is also necessary. We are concerned about 
			textual languages, whose concrete syntax is usually given as a BNF

			In recent years Semantic Web has drawn a lot of attention in order 
			to solve the problem of automatic discovery and processing of web 
			services. Although there are different efforts and frameworks for 
			semantic annotation and discovery of web services, they mostly 
			classify the discovered web services as set-based. Improvement in 
			matching process could be gained by the use of ontological 
			information in a useful form. The goal of this research is to 
			propose a more accurate discovery method using the ontological 
			distance information defined and ranked by users. In this paper, we 
			focus on one of the most challenging tasks in service discovery: 
			matchmaking process. We use an efficient matchmaking algorithm based 
			on bi-partite graphs. Our proposed algorithm uses attribute ranking 
			through weight assignment. Our experiment results show that 
			bi-partite matchmaking has advantages over other approaches in the 
			literature for parameter pairing problem. We present value added 
			approaches in matchmaking such as property-level matching, semantic 
			distance information and WordNet scoring. The value added approaches 
			provide better scoring scheme and allows similarity to be captured 
			resulting in ranking of services according to their relatedness.</DIV></TD></TR>  <TR><TD height=23 colSpan=2 vAlign=top class="Textojustificadoazulescuro"><HR></TD></TR>

			Test-driven development is a novel software development practice and 
			part of the Extreme Programming paradigm. It is based on the 
			principle that tests should be designed and written for a module 
			iteratively, while the code of the module is devised. This is the 
			opposite of what is usual in current software development methods in 
			which testing is often an afterthought, rather than a primary 
			driving factor of design. Once applied systematically and 
			continuously, test-driven development is supposed to incorporate 
			requirements changes easier, lead to superior technical solutions in 
			software, result in better and cleaner code, and motivate all 
			stakeholders. We present a development project carried out in a 
			company in which we put those claims to a test. We found that, 
			indeed, some of the claims are valid, but we can also report 
			difficulties with applying the test-driven development approach.</DIV></TD></TR>  <TR><TD height=23 colSpan=2 vAlign=top class="Textojustificadoazulescuro"><HR></TD></TR>

			Unstable requirements are widely understood as being a common cause 
			of problems in delivering desired software functionality on time and 
			within budget. Requirement volatility manifests itself through 
			various symptoms, including scope creep, rejected feature 
			implementations, and late discovery of non-functional requirements. 
			Iterative processes use cycles of development and feedback to create 
			an environment where requirements can be evolved to better address 
			the user&#8217;s needs. Agile development methods are based on the 
			assumption that the most valuable feedback comes from customers 
			reviewing a live demo of the system being developed. The duration of 
			an iteration generally determines the frequency of such reviews, and 
			we are interested in understanding its impact on the development 
			process. We developed a discrete simulation model of iterative 
			development processes, and use it to evaluate process efficiency. By 
			simulating the process for different iteration durations and initial 
			requirement stability levels, we show that efficiency in iterative 
			development processes depends on how well the iteration duration is 
			adjusted to the initial requirement stability. We also propose a 
			method for actively evaluating requirement stability, and using that 
			information to adjust the review frequency during the execution of a 
			development project.</DIV></TD></TR>  <TR><TD height=23 colSpan=2 vAlign=top class="Textojustificadoazulescuro"><HR></TD></TR>

		Abstract:</DIV></TD><TD class="textoNormal" vAlign="center"><DIV align=justify>
			Evolutionary Design is Extreme Programming&#8217;s approach to organize 
			software structure and its relationships, encouraging refactoring, 
			test driven development and the simplest solution for the 
			requirements of a single iteration, thus avoiding a big up-front 
			design activity at the beginning of the project that can cause 
			carrying on a huge structural complexity throughout the whole 
			project. In order to contrast this approach with a planned or 
			traditional design approach, an empirical evaluation of impact on 
			software design quality and process productivity has been designed 
			and conducted in an academic environment with toy size problems. 
			Experimental studies planning details are presented, and two 
			replications with different experimental designs are described. 
			Results suggest that there are no differences in quality between 
			both approaches, and that productivity is better when a planned 
			design is adopted.</DIV></TD></TR>  <TR>
