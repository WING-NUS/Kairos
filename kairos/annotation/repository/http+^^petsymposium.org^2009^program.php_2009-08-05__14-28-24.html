	Abstract: <i>Protests in Iran are organized over Twitter and Facebook.  Chinese citizens confront mandatory installation of filtering software.  U.S. Border Agents have plenary authority to seize laptops and phones entering the country. Mobile phones constantly report their location to the cellular network.  These are some of today's hot spots where legal action is inadequate to protect people's privacy.  Technological solutions are needed, and this is a call to action for scientists, researchers and coders.  However, the technological solutions may not be something new and different, but rather something familiar and simple.  Proxy servers, default https and privacy-friendly data retention practices may have the most privacy-friendly effects.<br/></i></td></tr>

	<tr class="speaker"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><br/>
	Abstract: <i>I will present a number of experiments investigating privacy valuations and decision making through the lenses of behavioral economics. Contrary to the
assumption in much social science that people have stable, coherent preferences with respect to personal privacy, we find that privacy valuations (measured by willingness to trade-off personal information for monetary rewards) and concerns about privacy  measured by divulgence of private information) are highly sensitive to contextual factors.  We report results from a number of experiments, one of which was designed to measure individual willingness to pay to protect and willingness to accept to divulge personal data; while others were designed to elicit or to suppress privacy concerns.  This research raises questions about whether individuals are able to navigate in a self-interested fashion increasingly complex issues of privacy.<br/></i></td></tr>
