        	<p class="abstract">Back eight years ago, XSLT had just been released and yet,
			missing features began to be missing. A few features were
			identified as possible extensions to and within the context
			of the standard recommendation, and were gathered under one
			single project: EXSLT.
		</p>
		<p class="abstract">
			EXSLT helped a lot writing XSLT 1.0 stylesheets that are
			portable across several processors, and showed the way for some
			features of what was going to become XSLT 2.0.
		</p>
		<p class="abstract">
			Now, XSLT 2.0 is just two years old. And yet, missing features
			begin to be missing. It is now time for EXSLT 2.0! As EXSLT
			has been launched soon after XSLT 1.0 was released, it is
			time to define what EXSLT 2.0 should provide in the next few
			years.
		</p>
		<p class="abstract">
			This introduction presents the EXSLT 2.0 initiative, some of its
			goals, and ideas about useful extensions. It will introduce a
			proposal of HTTP client extension, and show possible usages by
			example. Eventually, it will provide a description of the
			potential extensions landscape and possible applications.

			</p>
			<p class="abstract">
			Profilers, unit test frameworks, and other tools of conventional programming are similarly available for XSLT but are not widely used. This presentation surveys the available tools for ensuring the quality of your XSLT.
		</p>
		<p class="abstract">
			There is no one-size-fits-all solution when looking for tools. For example, if you are using Saxon and Ant, then you are looking for a different set of tools than if you are using libXSLT and Makefiles.
		</p>
		<p class="abstract">
			This presentation covers XSLT-specific tools and techniques. It does not at this point propose to cover general XML tools and techniques such as schema validation or Schematron: they are of course useful, and could be added, but XSLT tools provide plenty to cover in a single timeslot.

        	<p class="abstract">XSLT is the canonical XML vocabulary for transforming XML, but the creators of realtime server applications such as chatrooms and virtual worlds have tended to rely on lower-level technologies such as SAX and DOM for manipulating XML client-server protocols. The goal of the open-source Xcruciate project is to develop a generic server solution based around XSLT, with I/O, data storage and application code in XML.
			</p>
			<p class="abstract">
			Theorists have discussed the extent to which XSLT is Turing-complete, with Dimitre Novatchev's FXSL showing what is possible within a single transformation. The Xcruciate team has taken a less pure and more pragmatic approach, using a LibXSLT-based virtual machine to perform successive transformations on state data and to handle I/O to multiple clients via socket connections.
		</p>
		<p class="abstract">
			An all-XML server implementation offers a number of advantages compared to bespoke OOP code, notably by enabling snapshots of the entire environment through serialisation. The main challenge has been balancing the conceptual elegance of pure XSLT with the need for rapid throughput and relatively concise application code.
		</p>
		<p class="abstract">
			The talk will focus on the design decisions made in the course of Xcruciate's development and the challenges encountered during implementation, as well as giving a taste of server application development within an all-XML environment.

        	<p class="abstract">
			The XML Schema (XSD) specification from W3C is a paradox: it is one of the
			most heavily criticised specifications to come out of the organisation, but
			at the same time it has been widely adopted and implemented, and it can be
			said to have met all its design objectives.</p>
			<p class="abstract">
			For some time the responsible working group has been developing a new
			version, XSD 1.1, which is starting to get close to the finish line. Many of
			the difficulties with the specification (such as its immense complexity)
			will still be there, but some of the criticisms, notably those concerned
			with the limited functionality of the spec, are met head on with some
			powerful new features. This talk will give a quick overview of what's new,
			while concentrating in particular on the way in which Assertions are likely
			to change the way in which XSD is used. Assertions, borrowed from
			Schematron, supplement the ability to define constraints using grammar and
			datatypes by a general predicate mechanism based on XPath. Already
			implemented in Saxon, they offer far more than the obvious ability to define
			boolean constraints: the talk will explain how they can be used as a
			powerful mechanism for tailoring and specializing schemas for use in
			different environments within an industry community.</p>
			<p class="abstract">
			The speaker, Dr Michael Kay, is founder of Saxonica Limited which develops
			the popular Saxon XSLT, XQuery, and XML Schema engine. He is a member of the
			W3C working groups for all three languages, and author of XSLT 2.0
			Programmer's Reference, the definitive Wrox guide to the language, recently
			republished in a fourth edition.

This presentation examines reuse from various points of view, from the author's to the developer's, offering practical strategies for reuse of content. Markup design is discussed, as are necessary prerequisites for making such a system work. What should be reused, and when? How do you uniquely identify a resource, and what, exactly, is a resource anyway? How do you design a user interface that helps the author instead of hindering her? From a practical point of view, how do you design a publishing process that works?</p>
			<p class="abstract">
			A demonstration of such a system illustrates the points made.

        	<p class="abstract">Test-driven development is one of the corner stones of Agile development, providing quick feedback about mistakes in code and freeing developers to refactor safe in the knowledge that any errors they introduce will be caught by the tests. There have been several test harnesses developed for XSLT, of which XSpec is one of the latest. XSpec draws inspiration from the behaviour-driven development framework for Ruby, called RSpec, and focuses on helping developers express the desired behaviour of their XSLT code. This talk will discuss the XSpec language, its implementation in XSLT 2.0, and experience with using XSpec on complex, large-scale projects.

        	<p class="abstract">XProc, or the XML Pipeline Language, has every potential to become one of the most useful new XML technologies around. The language has recently become a W3C Candidate Recommendation and is gathering growing interest in the XML community, both from the users and implementers.</p>
			<p class="abstract">
			Following the progress of the specification, and the evolution of the language to its present form, XProc has been successfully deployed in a dynamic content delivery platform, where it has quickly proved its strengths and established itself as the primary technology for XML data manipulations.</p>
			<p class="abstract">
			In this paper, we will briefly discuss the design principles behind XProc implementation and then proceed by illustrating how XProc can be leveraged in the XML content delivery context. We will present a number of use cases and show some XProc pipelines that can be used for implementing the relevant functionality. For each use case, we will start by formulating a relatively simple introductory scenario (usually with equally simple solution) to get the reader familiar with the problem – and to show that even the simplest XProc pipelines can provide us with enough power for our needs. After that, we move on to a more challenging scenario, which will require us to use more complex XProc pipelines.

				<p class="abstract">The paper describes Xdefinition 2.1 as an integral instrument for the design and development of projects with XML objects. In our development of Xdefinitions we concentrated on their application in the process of XML documents throughout the life cycle of the information system creation. This cycle typically includes discussions and negotiations with partners, analysts and implementators. We emphasized comprehensibility for all participants of the individual stages of IS formation as well as the binding character. The description of XML objects structures by means of Xdefinitions is easy to understand not only for informatics experts but also for a wider spectrum of participants who inevitably take part in the project implementation. By the binding character we mean the usability of the description for machine processing (description of data structures includes also processing code). Compared to the previous versions the Xdefinitions 2.1 thus allow also to define links of the objects to different situations in the course of their processing.</p>
