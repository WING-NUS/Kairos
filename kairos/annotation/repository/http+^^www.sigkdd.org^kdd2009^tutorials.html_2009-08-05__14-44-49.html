                  <h2><a name="t1"></a>T1 - Statistical Challenges in Computational Advertising </h2>
                    <p>Deepayan Chakrabarti, Deepak Agarwal</p>
                    <p>Many organizations now devote significant fractions of their
                      advertising/outreach budgets to online advertising; ad-networks like
                      Yahoo!, Google, MSN have responded by constructing new kinds of
                      economic models and perform the fundamental task of matching the most
                      relevant ads (selected from a large inventory) for a
                      (query,user) pair in a given context. Nearly all of
                      the challenges that arise are substantially data- or model-driven (or
                      both). Computational Advertising is a relatively new scientific
                      sub-discipline at the interesection of large scale search and text
                      analysis, information retrieval, statistical modeling, machine
                      learning, optimization and microeconomics that address this
                      match-making problem and provides unprecedented opportunities to data
                    miners.</p>
                    <p>Topics covered include a comprehensive introduction to several
                      advertising forms (sponsored search, contextual adverting,
                      display advertising), revenue models (pay-per-click, pay-per-view,
                      pay-per-conversion) and data mining challenges involved, along with an
                      overview of state-of-the-art techniques in the area with a detailed
                      discussion of open problems.  We will cover
                      information retrieval techniques and their limitations; data mining
                      challenges involved in performing ad matching through clickstream
                      data and challenging optimization issues that arise in display
                      advertising. In particular, we will cover statistical modeling 
                      techniques for
                      clickstream data and explore/exploit schemes to perform online
                      experiments for better long-term performance using multi-armed bandit
                      schemes. We also discuss the close relationship of techniques used in
                      recommender systems to our problem but indicate several additional
                      issues that needs to be addressed before they become routine in
                  computational advertising.</p>
                    <p>We will only assume basic knowledge of statistical methods, no prior
                      knowledge of online advertising is required. In fact, the first hour
                      that provides an introduction to the area would be appropriate for all
                      registered attendees of KDD 2009. The second half would require
                      familiarity with basic concepts like regression, probability
                      distributions and appreciation of issues involved in fitting
                      statistical models to large scale applications. No prior knowledge of
                  multi-armed bandits would be assumed.</p>

                    <h2><a name="t2"></a>T2 - How to do good research, get it published in SIGKDD and get it cited!</h2>
                    <p>Eamonn Keogh</p>
                    <p>While SIGKDD has traditionally enjoyed an unusually high quality of reviewing, there is no doubt that publishing in SIGKDD (and other high quality data mining conferences) is very challenging. This is especially true for young faculty, grad students whose primary advisor is not an experienced SIGKDD author, or people from outside the community (i.e. a biologist or mathematician who has a result that might greatly interest the data mining community).</p>
                    <p>In this tutorial Dr. Keogh will demonstrate some simple ideas to enhance the probability of success in getting your paper published in a top data mining conference; and after the work is published, getting it highly cited.</p>
                    <p>These tips and tricks are based on 12 years experience as a SIGKDD author and reviewer, and wisdom solicited from many of the most prolific data mining researchers/reviewers.</p>
                    <p>Topics covered in the tutorial include: </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li> Finding the right problems to work on (80% of the battle).</li>
                      <li>                        Don't summarize, sell! Writing abstracts that put the reviewer on your side from the start.</li>
                      <li>                        Getting or creating the perfect dataset.</li>
                      <li>                        Experiments that tell a story.</li>
                      <li>                        Making effective and interesting figures.</li>
                      <li> Getting the reviewers on your side.</li>
                      <li> The top-ten avoidable reasons why papers get rejected from SIGKDD.</li>
                      <li>                        Three simple tricks to increase the number of citations to your work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While Dr. Keogh does not claim to have a &ldquo;magic bullet&rdquo; for publishing in SIGKDD, his significant track record of publishing in top data mining venues, combined with extensive (and deliberately uncredited) experience in helping younger researchers &ldquo;break-in&rdquo; to SIGKDD have placed him in a unique position to share useful and actionable advice.</p>
                    <p>While writing this tutorial Dr. Keogh, sought and received advice from many respected data mining researchers, their advice is incorporated into this tutorial.</p>

                    <h2><a name="t3"></a>T3 - Large Graph-Mining: Power Tools and a Practitioner's Guide</h2>
                  <p>Christos Faloutsos, Gary Miller, Charalampos (Babis) Tsourakakis</p>
                    <p>Numerous real-world datasets are in matrix form, thus matrix algebra, linear and multilinear, provides important algorithmic tools for analyzing them. The main type of datasets of interest in 
                    this tutorial are graphs. Important datasets modeled as graphs include the Internet, the Web, social networks (e,g Facebook, LinkedIn), computer networks, biological networks and many more.</p>
                    <p>We will discuss how we represent a graph as a matrix (adjacency matrix, Laplacian)  and the important properties of  those representations. We will then show how these properties are used in several important problems, including node importance via random walks (Pagerank), community detection (METIS, Cheeger inequality), graph isomorphism and graph similarity. Important dimensionality reduction techniques (SVD and random projections) will be discussed in the context of graph mining problems.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we provide a survey of the work on the epidemic threshold, node proximity and center-piece subgraphs. State-of-art graph mining tools for analyzing time evolving graphs will also be presented. Throughout the tutorial, patterns in static and time evolving, weighted and unweighted real-world graphs will be presented.</p>
                    <p>The target audience are data mining professionals who wish to know the most important matrix algebra tools, their applications in large graph mining and the theory behing them.<br>
                        Prerequisites: Computer science background (B.Sc or equivalent); familiarity with undergraduate linear algebra.<br>
                    Demos will be presented.</p>

                    <h2><a name="t4"></a>T4 - Planning, Running, and Analyzing Controlled Experiments on the Web</h2>
                    <p>Ronny Kohavi, Roger Longbotham, John Quarto-vonTivadar</p>
                    <p>The web provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate ideas quickly using controlled experiments, also called randomized experiments, A/B tests (and their generalizations), split tests, and MultiVariable Tests (MVT).  Controlled experiments embody the best scientific design for establishing a causal relationship between changes and their influence on user-observable behavior.   Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery techniques can then be used to analyze the data from such experiments.  The tutorial will provide a survey and practical guide to running controlled experiments based on the recently published survey article in the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal, co-authored with the two of the tutorial co-presenters (<a href="http://exp-platform.com/dmkd_survey.aspx" target="_blank">http://exp-platform.com/dmkd_survey.aspx</a>), and based on the book &ldquo;Always Be Testing&rdquo; co-authored by the 3rd tutorial co-presenter (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Always-Be-Testing-Complete-Optimizer/dp/0470290633" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Always-Be-Testing-Complete-Optimizer/dp/0470290633</a>).  The book includes use of industry tools, such as Google Website Optimizer and recently ranked #2 on Amazon&rsquo;s sales rank for computers/e-commerce books. The tutorial includes multiple real-world examples of actual controlled experiments (many with surprising results), a review the theory and the statistics used to plan and analyze such experiments, and a discussion of the limitations and pitfalls that might face experimenters.  Demos will be shown of some tools that support controlled experiments. </p>

                    <h2><a name="t5"></a>T5 - Predictive Modelling in the Wild: Success Factors in Data Mining Competitions and Real-World Applications</h2>
                    <p>Saharon Rosset, Claudia Perlich</p>
                    <p>In this tutorial, we give our perspective on the keys to success in 
                      application of predictive modeling to competitions like KDD Cup and 
                      real-life business intelligence projects. We argue that these two 
                      modes of applying predictive modeling share many similarities, but 
                      have also some important differences. We discuss the main success 
                      factors in predictive modeling: domain understanding, statistical 
                      acumen, and appropriate algorithmic approaches. We describe our 
                      relevant experiences in the context of three recent predictive 
                      modeling competitions where our team has had success (KDD Cup 2007 and 
                      2008 and INFORMS DM challenge 2008) and two case studies of projects 
                      we have led at IBM Research. We also survey some of the recurring 
                      challenges and complexities in practical predictive modeling 
                      applications. One key issue is information leakage, and we discuss its 
                      definition, influence, detection and avoidance. We consider leakage to 
                      be the silent killer of many predictive modeling projects, and we 
                      demonstrate its impact on the competitions, and discuss the challenges 
                      in addressing it in the real-life projects. Other challenges include 
                      framing real-life modeling objectives into predictive modeling, and 
                      usefully applying relational learning concepts when modeling &quot;real-life&quot; complex, relational datasets.</p>

                    <p>As data types and data structures change to keep up with evolving 
                      technologies and applications, data quality problems too have evolved 
                      and become more complex and interwoven. Data streams, web logs, 
                      Wikipedias, biomedical applications, video streams and social 
                      networking websites generate a mind boggling variety of data types. 
                      However, data quality mining, the use of data mining to manage, 
                      measure and improve data quality, has focused mostly on addressing 
                    each category of data glitch separately as a static entity.</p>
                  <p>In this tutorial we provide a technical, KDD-focused account of recent 
                      research and developments in discovering  and treating complex data 
                      anomalies in a broad range of data. In particular, we highlight new 
                      directions in data quality mining: (a) the applicability and 
                      effectiveness of the methodologies for various data types such as 
                      structured, semi-structured and stream data, (b) the detection of 
                      concomitant data glitches and patterns like the occurrence of outliers 
                      in data with missing values and duplicates, or the co-occurrence of 
                      missing values and duplicates, (c) the design of sequential approaches 
                      to data quality mining, such as workflows composed of a sequence of 
                      tasks for data quality exploration and analysis. We give an overview 
                      of past work, introduce current research in this area including recent 
                      methods and techniques for discovering complex patterns of anomalies 
                      (e.g., multivariate outliers, disguised missing values, combination of 
                    different types of noise), and highlight new directions and open 
                    problems in data quality mining.</p>
                  <p>The tutorial includes extensive case studies and practical examples of 
                      mining data quality problems for a variety of large datasets and data 
                      types e.g., relational, XML, data streams. We discuss illustrative 
                    examples drawn from a variety of domains like CRM, networking, 
                    biology, and mobility.</p>

                    <h2><a name="t7"></a>T7 - Event Detection</h2>
                    <p>Daniel Neill, Weng-Keen Wong</p>
                    <p>A common task in surveillance, scientific discovery and data cleaning
                      involves monitoring routinely collected data for anomalous events. Detecting
                      events in univariate time series data can be effectively accomplished using
                      well-established techniques such as Box-Jenkins models, regression, and
                      statistical quality control methods. In recent years, however, routinely
                      collected data has become increasingly complex. At each time step, the data
                      collected can consist of multivariate vectors and/or be spatial in nature.
                      For instance, healthcare data used in disease surveillance often consists of
                      multivariate patient records or spatially distributed pharmaceutical sales
                      data.  Consequently, new event detection algorithms have been developed that
                      not only consider temporal information but also detect spatial patterns and
                    integrate information from multiple spatio-temporal data streams.</p>
<p>This tutorial will present algorithms for event detection, with a focus on
          algorithms dealing with multivariate temporal and spatio-temporal data. We
          will introduce event detection by providing a general formulation of the
          event detection problem and describing its unique challenges.  In the first
          half of the tutorial, we will cover algorithms for detecting events in both
          univariate and multivariate temporal data. The second half will present
          methods for detecting events in spatio-temporal data, including several
                      recently proposed multivariate approaches.</p>

                    <p>Myra Spiliopoulou, Osmar Zaiane, Bamshad Mobasher, Olfa Nasraoui</p>
                    <p>The Web has changed our way of life and the Web 2.0 has changed our 
                      way of perceiving and using the Web. Data analysis is now required in 
                      a plethora of applications that aim to enrich the experience of people 
                      with the Web. We first discuss data mining for the social Web. We 
                      elaborate on social network analysis and focus on community mining, 
                      then go over to recommendation engines and personalization. We discuss 
                      the challenges that emerged through the shift from the traditional Web 
                      to Web 2.0. We then focus on two issues - the need to protect Web 
                      applications from manipulation and the need to make them adaptive 
                      towards change. We first discuss manipulations/attacks in recommender 
                      systems and present counter-measures. We then elaborate on how changes/concept drifts can be dealt with in applications that analyze 
                      clickstream data, monitor topics in news and blogs, or monitor 
                    communities and their evolution.</p>
                    <p>This tutorial is aimed at novice researchers that have general 
                      background in data mining and are interested in understanding the <br>
                      potential and challenges pertinent to the social Web. The participants 
                      should have a basic understanding of recommendation engines, 
                      personalization and text modeling for mining (vector space models). 
                      They will learn how basic techniques are extended and new techniques 
                      are designed for mining the Web, especially the social Web. They will 
                      also learn about issues that are still open and require further 
                      research - research that the tutorial participants may decide to 
                      perform themselves.<br>

                    <h2><a name="t9"></a>T9 - Real World Text Mining</h2>
                    <p>Ronen Feldman, Lyle Ungar</p>
                    <p>The proliferation of documents available on the Web and on corporate
  intranets is driving a new wave of text mining research and application. Earlier research addressed extraction of information from relatively small collections of well-structured documents such as newswire or scientific publications. Text mining from the other corpora such as the web requires new techniques drawn from data mining, machine learning, NLP and IR. Text mining requires preprocessing document collections (text categorization, information extraction, term extraction), storage of the intermediate representations, analysis of these intermediate representations (distribution analysis, clustering, trend analysis, association rules, etc.), and visualization of the results. In this tutorial we will present the algorithms and methods used to build text mining systems including pre-processing techniques, supervised leearning (e.g., CRF), entity resolution, relationship extraction, unsupervised learning and machine reading.<br>
  <br>
  The tutorial will cover the state of the art in this rapidly growing area of research, including recent advances in unsupervised methods for extracting facts from text and methods used for web-scale mining. We will also present several real world applications of text mining.  Special emphasis will be given to lessons learned from years of experience in developing real world text mining systems, including how to handle informal texts such as blogs and user reviews and how to build scalable systems.<br>

  The instructors are Ronen Feldman and Lyle Ungar. Ronen is an Associate Professor of Information Systems at the Business School of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He is the founder of the ClearForest text mining corporation, and the author of the book &quot;The Text Mining Handbook&quot; published by Cambridge University Press in 2007. Lyle is an Associate Professor of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania.He recently returned from a sabbatical at Google, where he and a team built what is probably the world&rsquo;s largest named entity recognition system.</p>
