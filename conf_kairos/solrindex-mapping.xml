<mapping>
	<!-- Simple mapping of fields created by Nutch IndexingFilters
	     to fields defined (and expected) in Solr schema.xml.

             Any fields in NutchDocument that match a name defined
             in field/@source will be renamed to the corresponding
             field/@dest.
             Additionally, if a field name (before mapping) matches
             a copyField/@source then its values will be copied to 
             the corresponding copyField/@dest.

             uniqueKey has the same meaning as in Solr schema.xml
             and defaults to "id" if not defined.
